# üîß Streamlit Cloud Troubleshooting

Common issues when deploying to Streamlit Cloud and how to fix them.

## ‚ùå FFmpeg Error (exit code 1)

This is the most common issue. Here's how to fix it:

### Solution 1: Verify packages.txt

Make sure your `packages.txt` file contains:
```
chromium
chromium-driver
ffmpeg
```

**Location**: Must be in the **root directory** of your repository (same level as app.py)

### Solution 2: Check FFmpeg Version on Streamlit Cloud

The FFmpeg version on Streamlit Cloud might not support certain codecs or options.

**What was fixed in the latest update:**
- ‚úÖ Better error reporting (shows actual FFmpeg error)
- ‚úÖ Conditional preset usage (only for x264/x265)
- ‚úÖ Added format filter for better compatibility
- ‚úÖ Checks for frame existence before encoding

### Solution 3: Use Compatible Settings

If FFmpeg still fails, the issue might be with codec/preset compatibility:

**Try these settings:**
- Codec: `libx264` (most compatible)
- Preset: `medium` or `fast` (not `slow` on cloud)
- FPS: 30 or 24 (not 60 on limited resources)

### Solution 4: Check Streamlit Cloud Logs

1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Click your app ‚Üí "Manage app"
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for the actual FFmpeg error message
5. The updated app.py now shows error details in an expander

### Solution 5: Memory Limits

Streamlit Cloud free tier has **1GB RAM limit**. If processing large/long videos:

**Reduce resource usage:**
```python
# In manual mode, use:
- Resolution: 1280x720 (instead of 1920x1080)
- Duration: 5s (instead of 10s)
- FPS: 24 (instead of 60)
```

### Solution 6: Test Specific Issues

The updated app now provides:
1. **Error expander** - Click "Show error details" to see what failed
2. **Frame count** - Shows how many frames were captured
3. **Browser detection** - Shows which browser is being used
4. **Detailed FFmpeg output** - Shows actual command and errors

## üîç Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check the Error Details
After you get the error, look for the "Show error details" expander and share that output.

### Step 2: Verify Files Were Uploaded Correctly
Make sure these files are in your GitHub repo:
- ‚úÖ app.py (latest version)
- ‚úÖ requirements.txt
- ‚úÖ packages.txt
- ‚úÖ .streamlit/config.toml

### Step 3: Force Streamlit Cloud to Rebuild
1. Go to your app settings
2. Click "Reboot app"
3. Or push a small change to trigger rebuild

### Step 4: Check Browser Initialization
The app should show: "Using browser: chromium" or similar.
If you see a browser error instead, the issue is with Selenium setup.

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Get Detailed Error Info

1. Run the conversion with a small test file
2. When it fails, expand "Show error details"
3. Copy the error message
4. Share it so we can fix the specific issue

### Common FFmpeg Errors and Fixes

| Error Message | Solution |
|---------------|----------|
| `Unknown encoder 'libx264'` | Add `ffmpeg` to packages.txt |
| `Invalid preset` | Use `medium` instead of `slow` |
| `No such file or directory` | Frames weren't created (browser issue) |
| `Invalid argument` | Check codec compatibility |
| `Protocol not found` | File path issue (should be fixed now) |

### Test Locally First

Before deploying, test on your local machine:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

If it works locally but not on cloud, it's an environment issue.

## ‚úÖ Updated Files

Make sure you have the latest versions:

### app.py Updates:
- ‚úÖ Better FFmpeg error handling
- ‚úÖ Detailed error reporting
- ‚úÖ Frame existence check
- ‚úÖ Conditional codec options
- ‚úÖ Multiple browser path detection
- ‚úÖ Better compatibility filters

### How to Update:

```bash
cd "/Users/lessafilms/Documents/HTML5 TO VIDEO"
git add app.py
git commit -m "Fix FFmpeg compatibility and error reporting"
git push
```

Streamlit Cloud will auto-detect and redeploy.

## üìä Resource Limits on Streamlit Cloud

| Resource | Free Tier | Recommendation |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| RAM | 1 GB | Use 720p, 5-10s max |
| CPU | Shared | Use fast/medium preset |
| Timeout | 10 min | Should be enough |
| Storage | Temp only | Automatic cleanup |

## üí° Best Practices for Cloud

1. **Start with Auto Mode** - It detects optimal settings
2. **Test with small files first** - Under 5 seconds duration
3. **Use 720p resolution** - 1920x1080 might be too much
4. **Use medium preset** - Faster encoding
5. **Check error details** - Use the new expander to see what failed

## üîÑ Alternative: Use Docker Deployment

If Streamlit Cloud continues having issues, consider:
- Railway.app (similar to Streamlit but more resources)
- Google Cloud Run (scalable)
- Your own VPS (full control)

See DEPLOY.md for instructions.

## Quick Checklist

Before asking for help, verify:
- [ ] `packages.txt` exists in root with `chromium`, `chromium-driver`, `ffmpeg`
- [ ] Latest `app.py` is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] App successfully rebooted on Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Tried with a small test file (5 seconds, 720p)
- [ ] Checked "Show error details" expander for actual error
- [ ] Logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard checked

If all checked and still failing, share:
1. The error from "Show error details" expander
2. Your Streamlit Cloud log output
3. Settings used (resolution, FPS, duration, codec)
